# AFLW-3D-2000
AFLW2000-3D is a dataset of 2000 images that have been annotated with image-level 68-point 3D facial landmarks. This dataset is typically used for evaluation of 3D facial landmark detection models. The head poses are very diverse and often hard to be detected by a cnn-based face detector.
